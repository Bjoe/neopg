# Easy to install

NeoPG comes in a single source package and installs as a single
binary.  No system services or global configuration are required.
Distributions and embedded systems can easily include NeoPG.

# Easy to use

NeoPG uses subcommands ("neopg encrypt ...") to provide contextual
help, highlights important information in the output with colors, and
reduces the complexity of common operations by providing sensible
defaults.  Arcane and obsolete features of OpenPGP are not supported.

# Easy to develop

NeoPG ships with a library and a command line interface to that
library.  Internal APIs are fully exposed and allow a high degree of
customization.  NeoPG is not a blackbox, and does not require indirect
manipulation of the environment or configuration to achieve a specific
goal.

# Strong community

NeoPG is a team effort.  Feedback is important to guide future
development, and bug reports are an early indicator of hidden
architectural problems.  NeoPG is moving to a liberal, inclusive
license (2-clause BSD).  And by making the code clean and simple, it
is easier to port to different platforms.

# Quality matters

NeoPG is developed under the control of continuous integration tests,
code coverage reports, static analysis tools and fuzzers.  Automatic
code formatting and continuous code quality checks help to make source
code readable and consistent.
